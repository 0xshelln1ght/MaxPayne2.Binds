# Installation
If you have widescreenfix installed, simply extract the files MaxPayne2.Binds.asi and MaxPayne2.ini into the game folder.
Or install https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader

# Configuration
You can bind your buttons in the file MaxPayne2.Binds.ini (default Z to save and X to load).
Notice that F5 and F9 will also work
